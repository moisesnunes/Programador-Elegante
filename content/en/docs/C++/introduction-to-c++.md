## Uma história básica

C++ is one of the most popular languages and it has been used for the development of many widely used applications. Although it is one of the older programming languages, C++ is steadily ranked among the most widely used and most powerful programming languages. C++ is not specialized for a specific application field; on the contrary, it is used for an impressive range of applications. For example, C++ is widely used to develop gaming applications, web applications, operating systems, networking applications, financial, browsers, compilers, embedded systems, and many more. A great number of popular applications that we all use in our daily life are written in C++. Also, it is more effective than many other languages for developing applications across a different range of computing systems and environments, such as personal computers, workstations, tablets, and mobile phones.

C++ originally derives from C, which was developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s by Dennis Richie and others. The rapid expansion of the C language and its increased popularity led many companies to develop their own C compilers. However, due to the absence of an official standard, features that were not clearly described could be implemented in different ways. As a result, the same program could be compiled with one C compiler and not with another. In parallel, the C language continued to evolve with the addition of new features and the replacement or obsolescence of existing ones. The need for the standardization of C language became apparent. In 1983, the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) began the development of the C standard that was completed and formally approved, in 1989, as ANSI C or Standard C. The ANSI C standard also defines a library that every ANSI C implementation must support. C++ also supports that library.

The design and development of C++ began at Bell Labs in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language. Stroustrup had several reasons to base C++ on C, such as C’s brevity, high performance, portability, and widespread popularity. In fact, the name C++ comes from the C increment operator ++, which increments the value of a variable by one. According to Stroustrup, the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C.
